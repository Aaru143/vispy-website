VisPy is a **high-performance interactive 2D/3D data visualization
library** leveraging the computational power of modern **Graphics
Processing Units (GPUs)** through the **OpenGL** library to display very
large datasets.


Getting started
===============

VisPy is under heavy development at this time, and we are still working on a
complete user guide for Vispy. VisPy targets two primary categories of users:

1. **Users knowing OpenGL**, or willing to learn OpenGL, who want to
   create beautiful and fast interactive 2D/3D visualizations in Python
   as easily as possible. Users in this category can write their own
   visualizations with :mod:`vispy.gloo` (requires knowing OpenGL/GLSL)

2. **Scientists without any knowledge of OpenGL**, who are seeking a
   high-level, high-performance plotting toolkit. Use the :mod:`vispy.plot`
   and :mod:`vispy.scene` interfaces for high-level work
   (**WARNING**: experimental / developing code).

Please check out the :doc:`gallery` for inspiration.
